# Machine Learning Exercises

This is just a git repository to sync all the exercises I did for the Coursera Machine Learning course:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
The purpose is to enable me to take the exercise from anywhere: in the office (please don't tell it to my boss) or at home (please don't tell it to my girlfriend).

Attention: You must leave here if you are also learning this course and you've not yet finished the exercieses. Work it out BY YOURSELF just as the teacher said. Good luck and enjoy :p
